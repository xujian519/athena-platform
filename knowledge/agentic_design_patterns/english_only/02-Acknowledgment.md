A special thanks to Patti Maes, who pioneered the concept of Software Agents in the 90s and remains focused on the question of how computer systems and digital devices might augment people and assist them with issues such as memory, learning, decision making, health, and wellbeing. Your vision back in '91 became a reality today.
